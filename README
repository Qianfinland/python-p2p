-----PYTHON-P2P-------------

This small project aims to implement short versions of popular P2P protocols in Python. It is mainly created for teaching purposes in the P2P course (URV university).

It does not implement any type of network communication like sockets. It just models as a python object a network node and it uses method invocation and instances to create the network and simulate routing.

The project is mainly focused on DHTs like Chord, Koorde or Symphony, but it also implement unstructured protocols (epidemics).

The project exports networks to the Pajek tool format.
